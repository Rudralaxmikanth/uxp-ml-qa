      "context": "Hello Everyone, my name is Rudra Laxmi Kanth, and I am a 3rd year undergraduate from IIT Madras. I joined Adobe on May 15, 23. I am thrilled to have joined the team as an intern, despite having no prior professional experience in this field. I am looking forward to learning from each team member. I have done a few projects in ML, and other projects like 16-bit hack computer in HDL, Reverse Engineering of L1 cache memory, etc. I am interested in the AI/ML field. I believe that this opportunity will allow me to learn and grow. Cricket and swimming are two activities I greatly enjoy. I am looking forward to working with all of you. Give a valid one",
